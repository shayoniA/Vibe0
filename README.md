‚ú® **Features**

1. **Category & Price Filterin**g ‚Äî Filter by categories like Clothing, Electronics, Home decor, and also by price range.
2. **Add to / Remove from / Update quantity of an item in Cart**
3. Product image Animation ‚Äî Products that have additional images show cyclic sliding animation when hovered over, in the home page.
4. Checkout with Receipt ‚Äî Shows total price of cart items, and provides a receipt with order details and ID, on checkout.
5. **Recommendations (You May Also Like section)**
  üîπRecommendation Logic:  Since we have a small dataset (8 products), performing Machine learning Clustering to provide recommendations isn‚Äôt ideal. Instead, I used a logical approach:  
   - Group products by category overlap with the cart items.  
   - Calculate the average price (x) of items in the cart.  
   - Recommend products sorted by their price difference from x.  
   This mimics user interest‚Äìbased recommendation while maintaining efficiency for small dataset.
